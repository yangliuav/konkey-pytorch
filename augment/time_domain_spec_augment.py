class TimeDomainSpecAugment(torch.nn.Module):
    """A time-domain approximation of the SpecAugment algorithm.

    This augmentation module implements three augmentations in
    the time-domain.

     1. Drop chunks of the audio (zero amplitude or white noise)
     2. Drop frequency bands (with band-drop filters)
     3. Speed peturbation (via resampling to slightly different rate)

    Arguments
    ---------
    perturb_prob : float from 0 to 1
        The probability that a batch will have speed perturbation applied.
    drop_freq_prob : float from 0 to 1
        The probability that a batch will have frequencies dropped.
    drop_chunk_prob : float from 0 to 1
        The probability that a batch will have chunks dropped.
    speeds : list of ints
        A set of different speeds to use to perturb each batch.
        See ``speechbrain.processing.speech_augmentation.SpeedPerturb``
    sample_rate : int
        Sampling rate of the input waveforms.
    drop_freq_count_low : int
        Lowest number of frequencies that could be dropped.
    drop_freq_count_high : int
        Highest number of frequencies that could be dropped.
    drop_chunk_count_low : int
        Lowest number of chunks that could be dropped.
    drop_chunk_count_high : int
        Highest number of chunks that could be dropped.
    drop_chunk_length_low : int
        Lowest length of chunks that could be dropped.
    drop_chunk_length_high : int
        Highest length of chunks that could be dropped.
    drop_chunk_noise_factor : float
        The noise factor used to scale the white noise inserted, relative to
        the average amplitude of the utterance. Default 0 (no noise inserted).

    Example
    -------
    >>> inputs = torch.randn([10, 16000])
    >>> feature_maker = TimeDomainSpecAugment(speeds=[80])
    >>> feats = feature_maker(inputs, torch.ones(10))
    >>> feats.shape
    torch.Size([10, 12800])
