class DropFreq(torch.nn.Module):
    """This class drops a random frequency from the signal.
    The purpose of this class is to teach models to learn to rely on all parts
    of the signal, not just a few frequency bands.
    Arguments
    ---------
    drop_freq_low : float
        The low end of frequencies that can be dropped,
        as a fraction of the sampling rate / 2.
    drop_freq_high : float
        The high end of frequencies that can be
        dropped, as a fraction of the sampling rate / 2.
    drop_count_low : int
        The low end of number of frequencies that could be dropped.
    drop_count_high : int
        The high end of number of frequencies that could be dropped.
    drop_width : float
        The width of the frequency band to drop, as
        a fraction of the sampling_rate / 2.
    drop_prob : float
        The probability that the batch of signals will  have a frequency
        dropped. By default, every batch has frequencies dropped.
    Example
    -------
    >>> from speechbrain.dataio.dataio import read_audio
    >>> dropper = DropFreq()
    >>> signal = read_audio('samples/audio_samples/example1.wav')
    >>> dropped_signal = dropper(signal.unsqueeze(0))
